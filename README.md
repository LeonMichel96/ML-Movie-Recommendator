# Movie Recommendator System
This project consists in building a movie recommendator system based on the
IMDB public datasets.
- The user will provide as input some of their most favorites movies.
- Using KNN algorithm we will find movies similar to the preferences and expand
the current favorite movies dataset.
- Using PCA K means means, dimensionality will be
reduced and movies will be clustered.

The final output will be a number of movie clusters
based on the user preferences.

Note: the raw datasets are too big to push to github,
you will need to download them locally.
